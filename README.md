In this academic coursework I created a report as part of a group, studying latitude dependent Energy Balance Models (EBM) in the context of modelling the temperature of Earth. 
We used a mixture of different analysis techniques to break down and study the governing differential equation including asymptotic analysis, finding steady state solutions using Python,
varying parameters in the model to see the resulting climate and analysing the likelihood of non-symmetric steady states around the equator. 

My contribution was all of Investigation 2, where we analyse non-symmetric steady states using a fitted Generalised Additive Model (GAM) to study a dataset for albedo allowing us to model the Northern and Southern Hemisphere independently.
This allowed us to deduce the existence of non-symmetric steady states and provided insight into the limitations of our model.
